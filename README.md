Overview

This was our first project created as students at Practicum using React!

The functionality at this point is complete, we have a few modals that can functionally open.

One modal is seen when clicking on one of the garmet pictures, the user can "preview" the image and is given the description of the image as well as the weather type that garmet is recommended to wear in.

The second modal is seen when the user clicks on the "+ Add new garmet" in the header. A form is opened giving a couple of inputs for the user to add a link to an image of the garmet as well as a description of the garmet and a couple of radio buttons to categorize the garmet in the desired weather type they would wear said garmet.

Modals for signing in and editing user profile.

Modal for deleting item card.

This App is now connected to the Backend Server created by express.

In this project we are also calling a weather API that is gathering longitude and latitude data to give clothing recommendations based on the weather in that area.

Figma

We based it off of a figma design:
